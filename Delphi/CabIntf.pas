 *      to compressed bytes is pretty obscure.  Also, since FCI compresses
 *      in blocks of 32K (at present), any files with data in a 32K block that
 *      spans a cabinet boundary require FDI to read both cabinet files
 *      to get the two halves of the compressed block).
 *
 *  Overview:
 *      The File Decompression Interface is used to simplify the reading of
 *      cabinet files.  A setup program will proceed in a manner very
 *      similar to the pseudo code below.  An FDI context is created, the
 *      setup program calls FDICopy() for each cabinet to be processed.  For
 *      each file in the cabinet, FDICopy() calls a notification callback
 *      routine, asking the setup program if the file should be copied.
 *      This call-back approach is great because it allows the cabinet file
 *      to be read and decompressed in an optimal manner, and also makes FDI
 *      independent of the run-time environment -- FDI makes *no* C run-time
 *      calls whatsoever.  All memory allocation and file I/O functions are
 *      passed into FDI by the client.
 *
 *      main(...)
 *      {
 *          // Read INF file to construct list of desired files.   
 *          //  Ideally, these would be sorted in the same order as the
 *          //  files appear in the cabinets, so that you can just walk
 *          //  down the list in response to fdintCOPY_FILE notifications.

 *                  set date, time, and attributes
 *
 *              case fdintNEXT_CABINET:
 *                  if not an error callback
 *                      Tell FDI to use suggested directory name
 *                  else
 *                      Tell user what the problem was, and prompt
 *                          for a new disk and/or path.
 *                      if user aborts
 *                          Tell FDI to abort
 *                      else
 *                          return to FDI to try another cabinet
 *
 *              default:
 *                  return 0;               // more messages may be defined
 *              ...
 *      }
 *
 *  Error Handling Suggestions:
 *      Since you the client have passed in *all* of the functions that
 *      FDI uses to interact with the "outside" world, you are in prime
 *      position to understand and deal with errors.
 *
 *      The general philosophy of FDI is to pass all errors back up to
 *      the client.  FDI returns fairly generic error codes in the case
 *      where one of the callback functions (PFNOPEN, PFNREAD, etc.) fail,
 *      since it assumes that the callback function will save enough
 *      information in a static/global so that when FDICopy() returns
 *      fail, the client can examine this information and report enough
 *      detail about the problem that the user can take corrective action.
 *
 *      For very specific errors (CORRUPT_CABINET, for example), FDI returns
 *      very specific error codes.
 *
 *      THE BEST POLICY IS FOR YOUR CALLBACK ROUTINES TO AVOID RETURNING
 *      ERRORS TO FDI!
 *
 *      Examples:
 *          (1) If the disk is getting full, instead of returning an error
 *              from your PFNWRITE function, you should -- inside your
 *              PFNWRITE function -- put up a dialog telling the user to free
 *              some disk space.
 *          (2) When you get the fdintNEXT_CABINET notification, you should
 *              verify that the cabinet you return is the correct one (call
 *              FDIIsCabinet(), and make sure the setID matches the one for
 *              the current cabinet specified in the fdintCABINET_INFO, and
 *              that the disk number is one greater.
 *
 *              NOTE: FDI will continue to call fdintNEXT_CABINET until it
 *                    gets the cabinet it wants, or until you return -1
 *                    to abort the FDICopy() call.
 *
 *      The documentation below on the FDI error codes provides explicit
 *      guidance on how to avoid each error.
 *
 *      If you find you must return a failure to FDI from one of your
 *      callback functions, then FDICopy() frees all resources it allocated
 *      and closes all files.  If you can figure out how to overcome the
 *      problem, you can call FDICopy() again on the last cabinet, and
 *      skip any files that you already copied.  But, note that FDI does
 *      *not* maintain any state between FDICopy() calls, other than possibly
 *      memory allocated for the decompressor.
 *
 *      See FDIERROR for details on FDI error codes and recommended actions.
 *
 *
 *  Progress Indicator Suggestions:
 *      As above, all of the file I/O functions are supplied by you.  So,
 *      updating a progress indicator is very simple.  You keep track of
 *      the target files handles you have opened, along with the uncompressed
 *      size of the target file.  When you see writes to the handle of a
 *      target file, you use the write count to update your status!
 *      Since this method is available, there is no separate callback from
 *      FDI just for progess indication.

		FDIERROR_NOT_A_CABINET,
				// Description: Cabinet file does not have the correct format
				// Cause:       File passed to to FDICopy(), or returned to
				//              fdintNEXT_CABINET, is too small to be a cabinet file,
				//              or does not have the cabinet signature in its first

		FDIERROR_UNKNOWN_CABINET_VERSION,
				// Description: Cabinet file has an unknown version number.
				// Cause:       File passed to to FDICopy(), or returned to
				//              fdintNEXT_CABINET, has what looks like a cabinet file
				//              header, but the version of the cabinet file format

		FDIERROR_CORRUPT_CABINET,
				// Description: Cabinet file is corrupt
				// Cause:       FDI returns this error any time it finds a problem
				//              with the logical format of a cabinet file, and any
				//              time one of the passed-in file I/O calls fails when
				//              operating on a cabinet (PFNOPEN, PFNSEEK, PFNREAD,
				//              or PFNCLOSE).  The client can distinguish these two
				//              cases based upon whether the last file I/O call
				//              failed or not.
				// Response:    Assuming this is not a real corruption problem in
				//              a cabinet file, the file I/O functions could attempt
				//              to do retries on failure (for example, if there is a
				//              temporary network connection problem).  If this does
				//              not work, and the file I/O call has to fail, then the
				//              FDI client will have to clean up and call the
				//              FDICopy() function again.
		FDIERROR_ALLOC_FAIL,
				// Description: Could not allocate enough memory
				// Cause:       FDI tried to allocate memory with the PFNALLOC
				//              function, but it failed.
				// Response:    If possible, PFNALLOC should take whatever steps
				//              are possible to allocate the memory requested.  If
				//              memory is not immediately available, it might post a
				//              dialog asking the user to free memory, for example.
				//              Note that the bulk of FDI's memory allocations are
				//              made at FDICreate() time and when the first cabinet
				//              file is opened during FDICopy().
		FDIERROR_BAD_COMPR_TYPE,
				// Description: Unknown compression type in a cabinet folder
				// Cause:       [Should never happen.]  A folder in a cabinet has an
				//              unknown compression type.  This is probably caused by
				//              a mismatch between the version of FCI.LIB used to
				//              create the cabinet and the FDI.LIB used to read the
				//              cabinet.
				// Response:    Abort.
		FDIERROR_MDI_FAIL,
				// Description: Failure decompressing data from a cabinet file
				// Cause:       The decompressor found an error in the data coming
				//              from the file cabinet.  The cabinet file was corrupted.
				//              [11-Apr-1994 bens When checksuming is turned on, this
				//              error should never occur.]
				// Response:    Probably should abort; only other choice is to cleanup
				//              and call FDICopy() again, and hope there was some
				//              intermittent data error that will not reoccur.
		FDIERROR_TARGET_FILE,
				// Description: Failure writing to target file
				// Cause:       FDI returns this error any time it gets an error back
				//              from one of the passed-in file I/O calls fails when
				//              writing to a file being extracted from a cabinet.
				// Response:    To avoid or minimize this error, the file I/O functions
				//              could attempt to avoid failing.  A common cause might
				//              be disk full -- in this case, the PFNWRITE function
				//              could have a check for free space, and put up a dialog
				//              asking the user to free some disk space.
		FDIERROR_RESERVE_MISMATCH,
				// Description: Cabinets in a set do not have the same RESERVE sizes
				// Cause:       [Should never happen]. FDI requires that the sizes of
				//              the per-cabinet, per-folder, and per-data block
				//              RESERVE sections be consistent across all the cabinets
				//              in a set.
				// Response:    Abort.
		FDIERROR_WRONG_CABINET,
				// Description: Cabinet returned on fdintNEXT_CABINET is incorrect
				// Cause:       NOTE: THIS ERROR IS NEVER RETURNED BY FDICopy()!
				//              Rather, FDICopy() keeps calling the fdintNEXT_CABINET
				//              callback until either the correct cabinet is specified,
				//              or you return ABORT.
				//              When FDICopy() is extracting a file that crosses a
				//              cabinet boundary, it calls fdintNEXT_CABINET to ask
				//              for the path to the next cabinet.  Not being very
				//              trusting, FDI then checks to make sure that the
				//              correct continuation cabinet was supplied!  It does
				//              this by checking the "setID" and "iCabinet" fields
				//              in the cabinet.  When MAKECAB.EXE creates a set of
				//              cabinets, it constructs the "setID" using the sum
				//              of the bytes of all the destination file names in
				//              the cabinet set.  FDI makes sure that the 16-bit
				//              setID of the continuation cabinet matches the
				//              cabinet file just processed.  FDI then checks that
				//              the cabinet number (iCabinet) is one more than the
				//              cabinet number for the cabinet just processed.
				// Response:    You need code in your fdintNEXT_CABINET (see below)
				//              handler to do retries if you get recalled with this
				//              error.  See the sample code (EXTRACT.C) to see how
				//              this should be handled.

 *          fSplit        - TRUE if this is a split data block
 *          cbPartial     - 0 if this is not a split block, or the first
 *                              piece of a split block; Greater than 0 if
 *                              this is the second piece of a split block.
 *      Exit-Success:
 *          returns TRUE;
 *      Exit-Failure:
 *          returns FALSE; error during decrypt
 *          returns -1; FDICopy() is aborted.
 *      Notes:
 *          FCI will split CFDATA blocks across cabinet boundaries if
 *          necessary.  To provide maximum flexibility, FDI will call the
 *          fdidtDECRYPT function twice on such split blocks, once when
 *          the first portion is read, and again when the second portion
 *          is read.  And, of course, most data blocks will not be split.
 *          So, there are three cases:
 *
 *           1) fSplit == FALSE
 *              You have the entire data block, so decrypt it.
 *
 *           2) fSplit == TRUE, cbPartial == 0
 *              This is the first portion of a split data block, so cbData
 *              is the size of this portion.  You can either choose to decrypt
 *              this piece, or ignore this call and decrypt the full CFDATA
 *              block on the next (second) fdidtDECRYPT call.
 *
 *           3) fSplit == TRUE, cbPartial > 0
 *              This is the second portion of a split data block (indeed,
 *              cbPartial will have the same value as cbData did on the
 *              immediately preceeding fdidtDECRYPT call!).  If you decrypted
 *              the first portion on the first call, then you can decrypt the
 *              second portion now.  If you ignored the first call, then you
 *              can decrypt the entire buffer.
 *              NOTE: pbData points to the second portion of the split data
 *                    block in this case, *not* the entire data block.  If
 *                    you want to wait until the second piece to decrypt the
 *                    *entire* block, pbData-cbPartial is the address of the
 *                    start of the whole block, and cbData+cbPartial is its
 *                    size.

 *
 *  The notification function for FDICopy can be called with the following

 *
 *  A typical sequence of calls will be something like this:

 *      fdintENUMERATE        // Ending enumeration
 *
 *  fdintCABINET_INFO:
 *        Called exactly once for each cabinet opened by FDICopy(), including
 *        continuation cabinets opened due to file(s) spanning cabinet
 *        boundaries. Primarily intended to permit EXTRACT.EXE to
 *        automatically select the next cabinet in a cabinet sequence even if
 *        not copying files that span cabinet boundaries.
 *      Entry:

 *      Exit-Failure:
 *          Returns -1 => Abort FDICopy() call
 *      Notes:
 *          This call is made *every* time a new cabinet is examined by
 *          FDICopy().  So if "foo2.cab" is examined because a file is
 *          continued from "foo1.cab", and then you call FDICopy() again
 *          on "foo2.cab", you will get *two* fdintCABINET_INFO calls all
 *          told.
 *
 *  fdintCOPY_FILE:
 *        Called for each file that *starts* in the current cabinet, giving
 *        the client the opportunity to request that the file be copied or
 *        skipped.
 *      Entry:

 *          the date, time, and attributes.  NOTE: This file handle returned
 *          must also be closeable by the PFNCLOSE function supplied to
 *          FDICreate, since if an error occurs while writing to this handle,
 *          FDI will use the PFNCLOSE function to close the file so that the

 *      Exit-Failure:
 *          Returns 0  => Skip file, do not copy
 *          Returns -1 => Abort FDICopy() call
 *
 *  fdintCLOSE_FILE_INFO:

 *        This function must close the file and set the file date, time,
 *        and attributes.
 *      Entry:

 *
 *              IMPORTANT NOTE:
 *                  FDI assumes that the target file was closed, even if this
 *                  callback returns failure.  FDI will NOT attempt to use
 *                  the PFNCLOSE function supplied on FDICreate() to close
 *                  the file!
 *
 *  fdintPARTIAL_FILE:
 *        Called for files at the front of the cabinet that are CONTINUED
 *        from a previous cabinet.  This callback occurs only when FDICopy is
 *        started on second or subsequent cabinet in a series that has files
 *        continued from a previous cabinet.
 *      Entry:
 *          pfdin->psz1 = file name of file CONTINUED from a PREVIOUS cabinet
 *          pfdin->psz2 = name of cabinet where file starts
 *          pfdin->psz3 = name of disk where file starts
 *      Exit-Success:
 *          Return anything other than -1; enumeration continues
 *      Exit-Failure:
 *          Returns -1 => Abort FDICopy() call
 *
 *  fdintENUMERATE:
 *        Called once after a call to FDICopy() starts scanning a CAB's
 *        CFFILE entries, and again when there are no more CFFILE entries.
 *        If CAB spanning occurs, an additional call will occur after the
 *        first spanned file is completed.  If the pfdin->iFolder value is
 *        changed from zero, additional calls will occur next time it reaches
 *        zero.  If iFolder is changed to zero, FDICopy will terminate, as if
 *        there were no more CFFILE entries.  Primarily intended to allow an
 *        application with it's own file list to help FDI advance quickly to
 *        a CFFILE entry of interest.  Can also be used to allow an
 *        application to determine the cb values for each file in the CAB.
 *      Entry:
 *        pfdin->cb        = current CFFILE position
 *        pfdin->iFolder   = number of files remaining
 *        pfdin->setID     = current CAB's setID value
 *      Exit-Don't Care:
 *        Don't change anything.
 *        Return anything but -1.
 *      Exit-Forcing a skip:
 *        pfdin->cb        = desired CFFILE position
 *        pfdin->iFolder   = desired # of files remaining
 *        Return anything but -1.
 *      Exit-Stop:
 *        pfdin->iFolder    = set to 0
 *        Return anything but -1.
 *      Exit-Failure:
 *        Return -1 => Abort FDICopy call ("user aborted".)
 *      Notes:
 *        This call can be ignored by applications which want normal file
 *        searching.  The application can adjust the supplied values to
 *        force FDICopy() to continue it's search at another location, or
 *        to force FDICopy() to terminate the search, by setting iFolder to 0.
 *        (FDICopy() will report no error when terminated this way.)
 *        FDI has no means to verify the supplied cb or iFolder values.
 *        Arbitrary values are likely to cause undesirable results.  An
 *        application should cross-check pfdin->setID to be certain the
 *        external database is in sync with the CAB.  Reverse-skips are OK
 *        (but may be inefficient) unless fdintNEXT_CABINET has been called.
 *
 *  fdintNEXT_CABINET:
 *        This function is *only* called when fdintCOPY_FILE was told to copy
 *        a file in the current cabinet that is continued to a subsequent
 *        cabinet file.  It is important that the cabinet path name (psz3)
 *        be validated before returning!  This function should ensure that
 *        the cabinet exists and is readable before returning.  So, this
 *        is the function that should, for example, issue a disk change
 *        prompt and make sure the cabinet file exists.
 *
 *        When this function returns to FDI, FDI will check that the setID
 *        and iCabinet match the expected values for the next cabinet.
 *        If not, FDI will continue to call this function until the correct
 *        cabinet file is specified, or until this function returns -1 to
 *        abort the FDICopy() function.  pfdin->fdie is set to
 *        FDIERROR_WRONG_CABINET to indicate this case.
 *
 *        If you *haven't* ensured that the cabinet file is present and
 *        readable, or the cabinet file has been damaged, pfdin->fdie will
 *        receive other appropriate error codes:
 *
 *              FDIERROR_CABINET_NOT_FOUND
 *              FDIERROR_NOT_A_CABINET
 *              FDIERROR_UNKNOWN_CABINET_VERSION
 *              FDIERROR_CORRUPT_CABINET
 *              FDIERROR_BAD_COMPR_TYPE
 *              FDIERROR_RESERVE_MISMATCH
 *              FDIERROR_WRONG_CABINET
 *
 *      Entry:
 *          pfdin->psz1 = name of next cabinet where current file is continued
 *          pfdin->psz2 = name of next disk where current file is continued
 *          pfdin->psz3 = cabinet path name; FDI concatenates psz3 with psz1
 *                          to produce the fully-qualified path for the cabinet
 *                          file.  The 256-byte buffer pointed at by psz3 may
 *                          be modified, but psz1 may not!
 *          pfdin->fdie = FDIERROR_WRONG_CABINET if the previous call to
 *                        fdintNEXT_CABINET specified a cabinet file that
 *                        did not match the setID/iCabinet that was expected.
 *      Exit-Success:
 *          Return anything but -1
 *      Exit-Failure:
 *          Returns -1 => Abort FDICopy() call
 *      Notes:
 *          This call is almost always made when a target file is open and
 *          being written to, and the next cabinet is needed to get more
 *          data for the file.
