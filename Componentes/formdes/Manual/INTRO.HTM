<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>FormContainer is a a native component designed for Delphi that
makes possible to insert a form as a child window into another
form. It can be used in all kind of applications. All we can say
is that 'we love it', just try it yourself.</p>

<p>The transition effects are a 'must have' for multimedia
applications, but you can also use them to create impacting
splash screens, for example. FormContainer can avoid flickering
by using a FlickerFreeTransition, or show and hide its child
forms using one of the several effects available.</p>
