<h3>FormContainer introduction</h3>

<p>FormContainer is a a native component designed for Delphi that
makes possible to insert a form as a child window into another
form.</p>

<p>For example, let's suppose we have designed the Form <em>TMyForm</em>,
and we want to insert it into a <a href="FormCont.htm"><em>TFormContainer</em></a>
called <em>MyFormContainer</em>:</p>

<dl>
    <dd><pre><font size="2">var
  AForm: TCustomForm;
begin
  AForm := MyFormContainer.CreateForm(TMyForm);
  MyFormContainer.ShowForm(AForm, True);</font><font
face="Times New Roman">
end;</font></pre>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>The possible applications of this feature are only limited by
your imagination You can easily develope very complex interfaces
that are much more powerful, robust and user-friendly.</p>

<p>Of course, the above example is a very simple. You can have
many forms attached to the same FormContainer, although only one
can be showed at the same time, control the alignment of each
one, show or hide it with a transition effect, and many more
things.</p>
