<h3>Control of reference</h3>

<p>The control of reference is the control used to render the
destination image of the transition. The area affected by the
transition has to be fully contained into the client area of this
control of reference. The windows that are going to be rendered
are this control and its corresponding childs. If another window
falls into this area it is not taken into account.</p>
