<h3>Transitions introduction</h3>

<p>A transition is a graphical effect that starts with a source
image and ends with a destination image. They are widely used in
TV and video, and are ideal for multimedia applications.</p>

<p>These transitions are independent of the CPU speed, completely
flicker free and the footprint is minimum.</p>

<p>FormContainer is fully integrated with the transitions, but it
is possible to use them with any other control.</p>

<p>If we have, for example, a TImage called <em>MyImage</em> and
want to change its picture using a <a href="fuse.htm"><em>TFuseTransition</em></a>
during 0.5 seconds:</p>

<pre><font size="2">	var
	  Fuse: TFuseTransition;
	begin
	  Fuse := TFuseTransition.Create;
	  try
	    Fuse.Milliseconds := 500;
	    Fuse.Prepare(MyImage, MyImage.ClientRect);
	    MyImage.Picture.LoadFromFile('NewPicture.bmp');
	    Fuse.Execute;
	  finally
	    Fuse.Free;
	  end;
	end;</font></pre>

<p>There are several transitions available, and it is possible to
create custom transitions.</p>
